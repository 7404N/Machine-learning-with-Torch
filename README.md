# Machine learning with Torch

This repository aims to be a collection of simple machine learning algorithms for [Torch7](http://torch.ch/).

## Regression with MLP

Usually [*multilayer perceptrons*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), (*MLPs*), are used for *pattern recognition* (a *classification* task) in the fields of *image* and *speech* recognition. Nevertheless, they can be effectively used for *regression*. Check out the `MLP-regression` section to find out more about it.
