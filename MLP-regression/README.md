# Regression with MLP

Reading Bishop's [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/), I got to the point in which a 3-layer [MLP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) with **1 input neuron**, **3 hidden neurons** and **1 output linear neuron** was used to regress some linear functions.
